# I worked on approximately 10,000 skin cancer images in the project. I used the CNN algorithm as a deep learning model.
#Project Parts
1. Environment and Library Setup: Setting up the environment and required libraries.
2. Data Frame Creation and Overview: Creating a data frame and getting a general overview of the data.
3. Data Preprocessing: Adding skin cancer images to the data frame as columns.
4. Read Pickle File: Loading and converting the above steps into a data frame object after the initial run of the program.
5. Standardization: Modeling based on image files to generate target class results for cancer types. One Hot Encoding is applied to numerically label the cancer types.
6. Deep Learning Algorithm: CNN modeling.
7. Creating Layers: Consists of Convolutional, Pooling, Flattenin, Dense, and Output layers.
8. Compiling the Model: Compiling the model, using the Adam optimization algorithm.
9. Training the Model: Training the model by testing different values for parameters such as epochs and batch size to achieve the most accurate results.
10. Using Our Models to Make Predictions: Improving the model by making predictions on new data. The GUI Skin Cancer Classification is the final stage, where skin cancer is classified, and a user interface is created.
11. Skin Cancer Dataset Features: Providing information about the dataset's features and visualizing the selected image to determine the likelihood and percentage of which cancer type it belongs to in the Result section. The cancer type with the highest probability is marked, and the values related to the image are listed in the Features section.
